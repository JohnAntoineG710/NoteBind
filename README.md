# Note Bind

Note bind is an application that helps users organize and categorize their notes in an intuitive way that gets out of the way, and lets the user focus on more important tasks.

### Roadmap

- Implement search in a single folder
- Implement search across all folders
- Integrate To-Do lists
- Add the ability to choose note/To-Do item colors from a predefined set.
- Add the ability to visually mark a note as important or requires attention.

### Technologies Used

- **React:** the main Front-End Framework used in NoteBind. Find out more [HERE](https://material-ui.com/)
- **Material-UI:** A modern and customizeable CSS framework. Find out more [HERE](https://material-ui.com/)
- **Nord Theme:** The main color theme used in the application. Find out more [HERE](https://www.nordtheme.com/)

  Please note that the application stores its data in the browser's **localStorage**. Despite the fact that data persists across browser refreshes, NoteBind is not meant to be used in production yet.
